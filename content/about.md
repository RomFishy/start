## About this website
This is my website, its my own space on the internet where I post anything that comes to mind, from blog posts to projects and updates.
I consider this website to be a part of the [Small Web](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/), a collection of personal websites that are away from "big tech" compaines

## Privacy and Analytics
Currently, I don't use any analyitcs on this website. I do, once in a while, check up on the traffic via Cloudflare.
I do plan to subscribe to an analytics service in the future, like [Umami](https://umami.is/) or [Plausible](https://plausible.io/).

## Technology
This website was built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) SSG and the [hello-friend-ng](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) theme.

The website is currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/pages) but I also plan to switch to my own VPS soon™️.

## Credits
I want to give credits to some people that I have took inspiration from for this website:
[Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk) and [Pukima](https://pukima.site) - [Uses](https://sheepdev.xyz/uses) page\
[Will Webberley](https://wilw.dev) - this page (about page)
